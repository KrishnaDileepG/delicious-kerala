          <h3>Appam and Stew</h3>
          <p>Appam and stew is a traditional dish from Kerala, known for its soft, lacy rice pancakes paired with a
            mildly spiced coconut-based curry. Appam is made from fermented rice flour and coconut milk, resulting in a
            pancake with a crispy, lacy edge and a soft, fluffy center. It has a slight sweetness and is often enjoyed
            with both vegetarian and non-vegetarian stews. The stew is a light, aromatic curry made with coconut milk,
            flavored with spices like cardamom, cinnamon, and cloves. It can include vegetables or meat, such as chicken
            or lamb, making it a comforting and flavorful dish. Commonly served for breakfast or dinner, Appam and stew
            is a staple in Kerala households and is often enjoyed during special occasions and festivals.</p>

          <h3>Puttu With Kadala Curry</h3>
          <p>Puttu and Kadala Curry is a classic breakfast dish from Kerala, known for its wholesome and nutritious
            combination. Puttu is a steamed rice cake made from coarsely ground rice flour and grated coconut, layered
            and cooked in a cylindrical steamer. It has a soft yet crumbly texture and a mild, slightly sweet taste from
            the coconut. Kadala Curry, on the other hand, is a flavorful black chickpea curry cooked with onions,
            tomatoes, and a blend of aromatic spices like turmeric, coriander, and garam masala. The curry is enriched
            with coconut milk or ground coconut paste, giving it a thick, rich consistency. The combination of Puttu and
            Kadala Curry is a perfect balance of textures and flavors, making it a beloved and energizing breakfast
            option in Kerala.</p>

          <h3>Kerala Fish Curry</h3>
          <p>Kerala Fish Curry, locally known as Meen Curry, is a flavorful and spicy dish that is an integral part of
            Kerala cuisine. Made with fresh fish, usually seer fish (neymeen), sardines (mathi), or kingfish (ayakoora),
            this curry is cooked in a rich and tangy gravy. The key ingredients include shallots, garlic, ginger,
            tomatoes, and a blend of traditional spices like turmeric, chili powder, and coriander powder. What makes
            Kerala Fish Curry unique is the use of kudampuli (Malabar tamarind), which adds a distinct sourness to the
            dish. It is traditionally cooked in an earthen pot (manchatti), enhancing the flavors further. Often paired
            with steamed rice or Kerala parotta, this curry is a must-try for seafood lovers.</p>
